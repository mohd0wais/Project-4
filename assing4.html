                <p>Today, our natural world is facing many problems like pollution, global warming, and cutting down trees. If we do not take care of it, our future will be in danger. We should plant more trees, save water, reduce waste, and avoid plastic. Every small step we take can make a big difference.

                <p>Nature plays a very important role in our daily lives. It provides us with air, water, food, and shelter — everything we need to survive. Forests give us oxygen, rivers give us water, and the soil gives us crops. Without nature, life on Earth would not be possible. We must protect the environment from pollution and deforestation to keep our planet green and healthy for the future.Nature plays a very important role in our daily lives.
